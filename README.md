## Description

This is a 3D portfolio made with ThreeJs. It is a simple 3D portfolio with a few 3D models and animations. It is a simple project to show my 3D skills.
With this project, I wanted to learn how to use ThreeJs and how to create 3D models and animations. I also wanted to learn how to use React Three Fiber and React Three Drei to create 3D models and animations in React.
Besides that, I wanted to learn how to use React Hook Form and Yup to create forms in React. I also wanted to learn how to use Hook Form Resolvers to validate forms in React.
Finally, I wanted to learn how to use React Router to create routes in React. I also wanted to learn how to use React Tilt to create a parallax effect in React. I also wanted to learn how to use React Hot Toast to create toasts in React. I also wanted to learn how to use Framer Motion to create animations in React. I also wanted to learn how to use EmailJs to send emails in React.
In this study, I benefited from the work of the Mastery YouTube channel [Three.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k)
